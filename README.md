# CS340_Project

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The purpose of this project was to develop a databased and Python module capable of CRUD functionality for MongoDB. The project required development of a dashboard and database interface logic; the dashboard includes attributes and a user-friendly interface that allows easy navigation with limited learning time. Additionally, the code used in this project is open sourced and will be uploaded on GitHub so that it may be replicated in future, similar projects. This README will serve as an instructional guide for future replication and contain all the sections of a standardized document.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first identifying what is known and unknown. Once I have determined the information and tools that will required to complete a problem, I prepare a roadmap that highlights the necessary components to ensure the problem is addressed fully. After I have begun working on a problem, I review lines of code to ensure that they meet the requirements necessary to correct the problem. Lastly, I ensure that ethical dilemas are not created and that the finish problem is free of bias.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design and implement technology used to solve various problems. They often create software, applications, and systems to serve a wide variety of functions while keeping various types of users in mind. The technology that is created by computer scientists often enables its users to more efficent at the task they are attempting which can greatly impact the proficiency of an individual or business.
